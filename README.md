# Pyber_Analysis

# 1.OVERVIEW
The purpose of the challnge was to be able to display ridesharing data visualization for PyBer. This was to help in access to ride share services and be able to determine if it was affordable in lower income areas.

Based on given ridesharing data and city data in CSV files, the data was used with Pandas to present a summary dataframe and chart to be able to visualize the data.



# 2.Results
# Total Fare by city type:

According to the data in the chart, the fare seemed to be steady over the time period in question. Rural areas not generating much revenue, where Urban did generate most of it. Suburban areas fall in between. 

# Summary DF by City Type

As seen in the data here, we can see that the main reason why Urban communites are king in providing revenue for rideshare services is because the total rides FAR out number the rural and suburban amount of rides. The amount of drivers for urban areas are much larger. However, due to the higher amount of drivers and rides, the average fare per ride is lower as well as per driver fare for every ride. In urban areas, ride sharing seems to be more affordable. 



# 3.Conclusion
Urban cities gernerate the higher revenue, where Rural is the least.
Rides are more affordable in  Urban areas not as affordable in suburban and even more so in rural.
